In this project, I implemented the sequential (two-pass) algorithm for connected component labelling. To tackle this problem, I split my program into three important functions. These functions are LabelComponents, ReduceLabels, and SizeFilter.

LabelComponents scans through the input image sequentially, inspecting each pixel. If a pixel is found that doesn't match the background color, it is marked. First, the pixels to the top and to the left of the current pixel are checked. Then, the algorithm given in the textbook is processed: if both labels agree, the current pixel gets this label as well. If one of the labels is non-zero, and the other label is zero, the non-zero label is chosen. If the labels disagree, the minimum is chosen, and an entry is added to the equivalency table.

After the equivalency table is generated, it is reduced to minimal complexity by following the chain of values to the smallest value in the set. These labels are then passed to ReduceLabels, which applies the minimal labels to the image.

After ReduceLabels has run, the SizeFilter function can optionally run. The point of this function is to remove elements below the threshold value, which is an optional value, in pixels, passed to the function at runtime. All elements less than threshold number of pixels in size are set to zero, and thus removed. In addition, ReduceLabels removes components from the set that have been zeroed out, so that LabelComponents returns the correct number of components.

RESULTS

I tested the code on the given images, as well as a very simple white block (4x4 pixels in size) that I created. My function returns the correct number of components on the test.bmp, face.bmp, and gun.bmp images (1, 6, and 4, respectively). In addition, when size filter is introduced (n=46 or greater), components are removed from gun.bmp. Increasing the threshold reduces gun.bmp to have only one component. If the threshold is high enough, part or whole of all the images are removed.
